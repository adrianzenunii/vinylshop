              Music sets a tone, impacts a mood, connects people, documents history, influences culture, and simply makes life better! At The Sound of Vinyl, we've long-proclaimed the superiority of music on vinyl, and we're here to make your collection look and sound better than ever. Our fandom is serious, but we don't take ourselves too seriously...

As one of the largest vinyl retailers on the web, we make it easy to find the albums you love and uncover some hidden classics. Sift through our shop by genre, artist, color vinyl, curated collections, and more.

Stay a while by joining our mailing list, signing up for our rewards program, getting personalized record recommendations, or starting your very own wishlist. We promise to respect your privacy and only deliver you stellar tunes and perks.

By the way, we appreciate an original vinyl pressing to the dark side of the moon and back, but we only sell brand new, shrink-wrapped vinyl here. Happy spinning from all of us at The Sound of Vinyl
